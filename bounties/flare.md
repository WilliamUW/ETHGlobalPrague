üèÜ MAIN TRACK: use protocols on Flare blockchain 
Use protocols on Flare blockchain in an innovative and world changing way!
Build DApps utilising at least one of Flare‚Äôs Enshrined Data Protocols:
* FTSO (Flare Time Series Oracle) for price feeds.
* FDC (Flare Data Connector) for Web3 and Web2 data sources,
* Flare‚Äôs Secure Random Number Generator, or
* FAssets to build dApps that use FXRP (synthetic XRP on Flare) bringing non-smart-contract XRP into DeFi.
Qualification Requirements
DApps must make use of at least one of Flare's enshrined Data Protocols.
Dapps must address real-world problems, or cater to specific use cases to be impactful.
Add Feedback in the README describing your experience with building on Flare.

Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.

1. My smart contract is deployed to Flare Coston2 Testnet: https://coston2-explorer.flare.network/address/0x886c7780A8Ae1DA1Eaf5f8D186FfbC3624fD3Cd7?tab=contract_code
2. TrustBuddy leverages Flare‚Äôs Secure Random Number Generator to gamify trust-building. When users submit reviews of social usernames (Telegram/Twitter/LinkedIn), the smart contract mints a variable amount of TBT (Trust Buddy Token) determined by Flare‚Äôs RNG, creating unpredictable rewards (e.g., 1‚Äì5 TBT per review). This ensures fairness, prevents reward gaming, and incentivizes honest participation.

How easy is it to use the API / Protocol? (1 - very difficult, 10 - very easy)

Had to request CFLR from a friend since https://faucet.flare.network/coston2 didn't work but otherwise the flare-foundry-starter template was very straight-forward to use!
